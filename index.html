    <p>Video games have been a longstanding passion and hobby of mine throughout my life. In the midst of the 2020 pandemic most everyone I know was staying home.<br>
        We had a lot of time to game to keep ourselves sane and in-contact. With this in mind, I figrued it would be a good topic for this project as I have logged some real hours in the game.<br>
        To save us all some time, I'm not going to explain the mechanics of a match and focus on my two most played champions of the current season.</p>

            <h2 class="headerColor"><img src="images/TopLaneLogoSmall.jpg" height="40" width="40">Main Role: Top Lane<img src="images/TopLaneLogoSmall.jpg" height="40" width="40"> </h2>
            <p class="text">The top laner is mosty typically the team carry or the main engage tool for team fights. Shoulders and backs can become sore from carrying your 4 teammates over the finish line for the sweet 'W'.<br>
                Top Laners also need to have high survability, high damage, or a good engage. The lane also gives the player a chance to flex their 1v1 skills.</p>

            <h2 class="headerColor">Most Played Champion: Garen</h2>
            <img src="images/DemaciaViceGaren.jpg" height=400 width=600>
            <p class="text">Pick Rate in Season 11: 60.16%<br>
                Win Rate in Season 11: 64.9%<br></p>
            <p class="text">A lot of top lane players call Garen a brain-dead champ. He has this reputation because his abilities do not have a Mana/Energy cost, his passive is a heal, and his Ultimate is an execute.<br>
                All the player needs to worry about are the cool downs.<br>
            They may say brain-dead, but I can hear them over the gold I get from winning the lane.</p>

        <article>
            <h2 class="headerColor">Second Most Played Champion: Darius</h2>
            <img src="images/GodKingDarius.jpg" height=400 width=600>
            <p class="text">Pick Rate in Season 11: 21.95%<br>
                Win Rate in Season 11: 48.1%<br></p>
            <p class="text">Unlike Garen, Darius' skills and abilities do have a Mana cost adding a degree of complexity to his play style. Darius' passive is a stacking bleed damage on the enemy champion.<br>
                After 5 consecutive hits on one target gets Darius fully stacked. Once fully stacked, his Ultimate can be devistating. If it ends in a take down, it resets, giving the possibility to string all 5 enemy champions.<br>
                Darius can be a menace in a match and can easily carry if played correctly. It all rides on the 1v1 and the 5 stacks, but that can also be his weakness.</p>
